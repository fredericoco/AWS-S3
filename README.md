## Repository for the work done on AWS S3
## What is S3?
S3 is a simple storage service. A database available on AWS. It's available globally and you can store anything. Used for disaster recovery (DR). We can apply Create bucket/object , read,update and delete (CRUD) actions. If there were a disaster in the location where our instances are located (Ireland for us) we would lose a lot of work.So we need to back them up. We need AWS SEC and ACCESS KEYs to access the S3.

S3 storage classes:
